#   Reflection week 2 hw
Fore me over these past 2 weeks, The **downloading of _Atom_ and _brackets_** was difficult and I still don't think they are working right. They have trouble **_opening the view_** where I can see what it looks like online and not in code. I had trouble navigating GitHub but now I am fairly proficient but, I still have **_trouble with gitgub desktop version_**.

but, on a brighter note, I also have **_started reading the book_** and **_refreshing my memory on HTML code_** that I learned in highschool and for the most part, are keeping up in my classes. I've made a few **_trial codes in both Atom and Brackets_**, I've made multiple **_repositories_** and connected them both with the online GitHub and the desktop GitHub which is connected through my files. And I completed week 1 homework and with this, I think week 2.

Through returning some of my HTML I remembered how to change the color of text, change text from **_bold_** to *italic*, to small and so on,` make borders around text,and change the background color` and so on. There are probably things I have probably forgotten to mention but that is what I have been doing. I myself think I need to be doing more and I'm probably right.
